# Simple Online Chess Server

This is a server for [Simple Online Chess project](https://github.com/HaS33n/ChessTakeTwo).
Maybe in the future I will implement multi threading but for now it stays *simple*.

## TODO list (unordered)

1. Add special moves (promotions, castles, en passant).
2. Add functionality that informs a user whether his king is check.
3. Implement game ending.
4. Test if it works (probably not c:).
